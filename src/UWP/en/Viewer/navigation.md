## Navigation

Navigating through the pages of a comic strip is one of the most important elements of comic book viewing. All navigation functionality is available by pressing the **Navigation** button.

But in addition, there are many additional features that allow you to navigate:
* The face indicator can be supplemented with the navigation buttons. Designed for devices with touch control only, but can be used at will and for any others.
* Navigation pads allow you to navigate using the mouse without sacrificing viewing.
* You can also control navigation with the help of a gamepad or keyboard. The section below describes the keys for navigation.

### Menu Navigation

After pressing the button **Navigation** the menu is opened. This menu allows you to configure navigation-related capabilities and perform the navigation itself. But since the management of the navigation itself through the menu is most likely not convenient, the following sections describe simpler methods of navigation. Here the work of navigation in general is described.  

#### Edge indicator

![Edge indicator](edgeindicator.jpg)  
This is a special control that marks the sides of the image that are inside the viewport or from its edge. Those. if the right edge of the image is reached, it means that we have reached the right end of the image. The sides in the face indicator are marked with green stripes on those sides of the image that are inside the viewing area or from its edge.  
To adjust the face indicator, go to the menu **Edge indicator** after pressing the button **Navigation** and activate or deactivate the necessary items:
* **Hide navigation on page** affects whether the navigation buttons will be displayed **Previous page or comics** and **Next page or comics** (they are visible in the figure at the beginning of the section as arrow buttons).
* **Hide navigation on edges** affects whether the navigation buttons will be displayed **On first page** –∏ **On last page**. This two additional buttons will be displayed to the right of the arrow buttons in the figure at the beginning of the section.  
* **Hide not actual buttons** affects whether the buttons are hidden **On first page**, **On last page**, **Previous page or comics**, **Next page or comics**, if they are visible thanks to the two settings above, then when there are no conditions for their operation. For example, when we are on the first page of a comic, the button **First page of the comics** is not active, if this setting is enabled at this point it will not be displayed in the control.

#### Navigation Panels

To open the navigation panel, simply drag the mouse to the left or right side of the window. the left side panel allows you to navigate to the previous page comic book, the first page of the comic book and the previous comic book (the button shown in the figure at the beginning of this section and are listed here from top to bottom).
