You can find filters and search by date of creation, date of last viewing, search by name and reading attribute and sorting the list.

## Sorting

Sorting the list allows you to arrange items depending on the selected sort field and sort direction.  
![Sorting panel](sort.jpg)  
**Sort by** allows you to select which field of the comics will be sorted. **Descending** allows you to specify the direction of sorting. If downward is active, then the rows will be sorted from the AZ number from 0-1 and the date from the past to the future is otherwise the opposite.

## Search and filter by the name of the comic and the sign of reading

If you need to find a comic by name, you must enter it in the **Name** full name of the comics or part of it. If it is necessary to find read and / or not read comics, check the corresponding items **Readed** Ð¸ **Unreaded**.
