## Adding Comics

The drComRead application allows you to import comics from the user's file system (including any cloud services that support synchronization at the file system level like OneDrive, DropBox, etc.). After importing, the comic is saved to the local storage of the application and no longer requires access to the files and folders from which they are imported.  
For your convenience, various options for importing files and folders are supported. You can import the archive formats CBR / RAR, CBZ / ZIP both alone and the list and even have the ability to find all the archives in the folder including all the subfolders and import them. Also in some cases there are comics distributed not in the form of a but in the form of folders with images. Of course, you can create the archive yourself based on this folder, but the drComRead application can do this for you.
